      <description>WelcomeWho’s Konrad, what is this blog and why am I here?I have an educational background in economics and econometrics; as a naturally inquisitive person, after university I started reading things unrelated to my job. This lead me to finding this half new half old thing called Machine Learning . After reading through some of the basics I thought “hey some of this looks incredibly similar to econometrics, with some nomenclature differences.</description>

      <description>Intro to Gradient DescentWhat’s going on hereThis is my first Data Science post on my blog. In this post i’ll be exploring my understanding of the Gradient Descent algorithm. My next post will explore how to implement this algorithm in R. Then i’ll have a play around with the function so we can all see the results of some pretty cool maths.
The Gradient Descent algorithm is the first algorithm presented by Andrew NG in his Machine Learning course.</description>
